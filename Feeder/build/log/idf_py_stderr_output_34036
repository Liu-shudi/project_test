CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory E:/self_project/Timi's feeder/Feeder/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory e:/esp32learn/handheld/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "E:/self_project/Timi's feeder/Feeder/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "E:/esp32learn/handheld/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
